This project is a Python application that allows users to download YouTube videos through a simple graphical user interface. The user pastes a video URL into a text box, and upon clicking the download button, the app fetches and downloads the highest resolution version of the video using the PyTubeFix library.

Libraries Used:
- tkinter (for creating the GUI interface)
- pytubefix (a library for downloading YouTube videos programmatically)

Note:
This project uses `pytubefix`, which is a modified or updated version of the original `pytube` library to handle common issues with YouTubeâ€™s changing API. A working internet connection and a valid YouTube video URL are required.
